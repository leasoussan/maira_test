Dear Maira. 

Thank you for taking interest in Kiwep, and your time :) 

Please note that my expectation are set to see how do you proceed when you have a task, and what you try in difficuties.

I would need you to make a Dahsboard page,  with a side NavBar that expends when hovered. 
The dashboard should have 4 box that takes up the space of the screen.

I would like that the navbar would be done with JS.

Now; I would like to see if you can get it done with the basic od Django.
I will send you in an email the book, but you can easily as well find online hos to get a django page working, then do on this the js.


So first step will be to set up a django app.
second stpe to make a page with sidenavbar dynamic. 

---->

Please comment here if you had any difficulties.
In the case you see troubles with the django, just commit to the rep an html with js.

Good luck.

Should be sent by Wednesday 10AM.

Hag Sameah.
